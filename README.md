It still didn't run!

When I chatted with a TA, he explained that the seed.sql file should have been seed.py, and that the databases mentioned in the exercise don't match. Cool, I fixed both. 

It still doesn't run!

Email validation no longer exists in whatever library we're trying to import it from? No problem! I just removed that line!

It still doesn't run!
